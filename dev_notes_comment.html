Prompt: I wanted starter code for a personal website with multiple pages and a nav bar.
What AI gave: a basic skeleton with linked HTML files and a simple nav bar.
What I did: I customized it a lot by adding spotlights, fun facts, crimson gradients, and changing the layout so it looked more like a portfolio than a template.

Prompt: I asked how to make the site responsive for phones and laptops.
What AI gave: CSS with flexbox, grid, and media queries. It worked but looked rough.
What I did: I fixed the spacing, margins, and font sizes so it looked good on both my laptop and my phone.

Prompt: I wanted to embed my resume inside the page.
What AI gave: an iframe snippet that displays a PDF in the site.
What I did: I followed that almost exactly since it was new for me, and just styled around it.

Reflection
AI sped up things that would have taken me hours, like setting up multiple HTML files and showing me how to embed a PDF. But I ran into issues too. The AI gave me broken paths for my project and resume pages at first, and I had to figure out that I needed Live Server to make the navigation work. Its responsive CSS didn’t look good on my screen sizes, so I ended up rewriting margins and breakpoints myself. Without AI I might not have even known to use an iframe, but without my fixes the site would have stayed generic and buggy. I let AI handle the parts I didn’t know, then I stepped in to clean things up, fix the bugs, and add my own style so the site finally felt like mine. I have also asked AI to add comments to all my files.
